# Beach Journal

Welcome to the Beach Journal app! This is my final project for the Flatiron School. It allows users to create and save beaches, as well as write journal entries for those beaches.

The backend for the Beach Journal can be found here: [https://github.com/Sdcrouse/beach-journal-client](https://github.com/Sdcrouse/beach-journal-client)
